This is my programming models Growth of Microalgae
All the files (.py) were programmed in Python 3.9

Topic 1.

# In the first document (Programming Growth Model microalgae) Is the programming of the proposed equations mentioned 
  in the article "A novel Phenomenological Model of Light that Predicts the Growth of Microalgae" is exposed
  This is an iterative programming that suggests the user to enter data and export the estimates calculated 
  by the mathematical models used. In this section you can obtain the graphs estimated by 
  the models and the data calculated for the creation of the graphs if the user so wishes.
