# This is my programming models Growth of Microalgae  

All the files (.m) were programmed in matlab 2020a

Topic 1.

    # In the first document (Growth_Microalgae) Is the programming of the proposed equations mentioned 
      in the article "A novel Phenomenological Model of Light that Predicts the Growth of Microalgae" is exposed
      This is an iterative programming that suggests the user to enter data and export the estimates calculated 
      by the mathematical models used. In this section you can obtain the graphs estimated by 
      the models and the data calculated for the creation of the graphs if the user so wishes.
      
Topic 2.

    # In the second document (Montecarlo_Simulation) Is the programming of the proposed for the validation of the 
    model through the use of random variables, the principle of the Monte Carlo technique, this document presents 
    an advance in programming to later be implemented in the main programming in the topic 1.
    
Topic 3.

    # In the third document (Optimization_Model) Is the programming obtained to matlab app "Curve Fitting" 
    It was used to arrange the data in each model of the investigation and determine the optimal parameters, 
    the correlation and the mean percentage error.
    
 Topic 4.

    # In the fourth document (Residual_Analysis) Is the programming for the learner regression of the model propoused 
    for the used prograaming Excel data are entered obtaining the linear regression graphs and the residual graph in the proposed model
